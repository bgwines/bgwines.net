					abstraction-finder is a program to do static analysis on code. It takes in a file and represents the functions and function calls as - respectively - nodes and edges: a graph.

					</br></br>
					The main idea is that abstractions work by hiding implementation details -- here, the heuristic provided for abstraction-classification is if all the functions in the encapsulation don't call any functions but each other (except for library functions, here interpreted as functions not defined in the given file).

					</br></br>
					The code can handle recursion of arbitrary order, and finds cycles by an algorithm similar to Tarjan's algorithm. It then collapses the cycles before finding abstractable sets of functions.

					</br></br>
					Then, the algorithm finds sets of functions that don't call any other non-library functions through DFS.

					</br></br>
					Functions that don't call each other and don't have any children of any depth that call each other or the functions in question can also be bundled together; after all, they also fit our criteria. Thus, an exponential number of abstractions is possible (visualise a set where all functions are leaf-functions).

					</br></br>
					The point of the program is to execute the algorithm, not to do complicated parsing on the input file, so the parser is rather limited.

					</br></br>
					It's written in Python, in September 2013, and is located <a href="https://github.com/bgwines/abstraction-finder" style="color: 268bd2">here</a>.
