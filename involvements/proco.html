					<a href="http://proco.stanford.edu" style="color: 268bd2">Stanford ProCo</a> is a student group dedicated to furthering high school computer science education in the Bay Area through programming competitions. In addition to our work to help local high schools start and run their own competitions, we also host our own annual competition (last year, we had over 400 registrants).

					</br></br>
					I've been involved with ProCo for five years, since the first year after its inception. In its '12-'13 year, I was president of the organization, and in the years before, I was involved in problem-writing.
